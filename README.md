# Predicting wildfires in Europe using open source data
Within a university study project we tried to predict wildfire probabilities in europe based on open source data. Our main data sources were the MODIS fire product, copernicus landcover variables and worldclim data for the current and the future climate. 
Contributing authors are Moritz Meinken, Kolja Enste and Jan Steen. All three authors are studying MSc. Landscape ecology at University MÃ¼nster.
